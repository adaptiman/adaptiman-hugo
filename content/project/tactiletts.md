## About TactileTTS

TactileTTS is an iOS app that can be used to listen to audio texts such as excerpts from textbooks. The app allows the user to control the navigation of audio texts using swipe and tap gestures. Currently, the app can navigate by sentence and paragraph, and pause the text.

The app also has the ability to send navigation information back to the researcher so that participants that use the app can contribute to the research.

TactileTTS is designed to examine the effects of navigation on the comprehension of audio texts.

Participants who complete the study have the option of entering a drawing for one of two $100 gift cards to be given away at the end of the study.
