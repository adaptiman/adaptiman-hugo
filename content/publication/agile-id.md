abstract = "Instructional design models describe in detail methodologies for designing effective instruction. Several widely adopted models include suggestions for managing instruction design projects. However, these suggestions focus on how to manage the instructional design steps rather than the instructional design and development team process. The application of project management models emphasizing team processes can fill a gap. In this article, the authors demonstrate an application of agile project management methodology (agile) to the instructional design process by describing the hallmakrs of agile, presenting an example from the field, and describing what methods did and did not work in one case. They then describe the link between design and development processes and the instructional design team's performance."
